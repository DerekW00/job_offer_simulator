# Screenshot placeholder

When you run the simulator, take a screenshot of the application and save it as screenshot.png in this directory.

Example command:
```bash
# Take a screenshot and save it here
cp your_screenshot.png docs/images/screenshot.png
```

This will be displayed in the README.md file.
