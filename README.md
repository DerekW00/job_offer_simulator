A Monte Carlo simulation engine that estimates your probability of receiving a job offer within a given timeframe based on your application strategy, resume quality, interview preparation, and market conditions.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-offer-simulator.git
cd job-offer-simulator

# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Generate sample data
poetry run python scripts/seed_fake_data.py

# Run the Streamlit app
poetry run streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Then visit http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

## üéØ What Does It Do?

The Job Offer Simulator helps you:

1. **Estimate Probabilities**: Calculate your chances of receiving a job offer within a specific timeframe
2. **Run What-If Scenarios**: See how changes to your application strategy affect outcomes
3. **Visualize Outcomes**: Explore interactive charts of offer probability over time
4. **Optimize Strategy**: Find the most effective ways to improve your job search

## üí° Why Is It Useful?

Job searching is inherently probabilistic, but most people approach it with a deterministic mindset. This simulator helps you:

- **Set Realistic Expectations**: Understand the likely timeline and outcomes of your search
- **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: Identify which factors most improve your chances
- **Reduce Anxiety**: Replace uncertainty with probability-based planning
- **Allocate Resources**: Focus your efforts where they have the highest impact

## üõ†Ô∏è How Does It Work?

The simulator uses Monte Carlo methods to model the job application process as a series of probability-weighted transitions:

1. **Application ‚Üí Phone Screen**: Affected by resume quality, referrals
2. **Phone Screen ‚Üí Interview**: Affected by interview preparation
3. **Interview ‚Üí Technical Rounds**: Affected by technical skills, preparation
4. **Technical ‚Üí Onsite**: Affected by technical performance, experience
5. **Onsite ‚Üí Offer**: Affected by overall performance, cultural fit
6. **Offer ‚Üí Acceptance**: Affected by market conditions, competing offers

Each simulation runs thousands of virtual job searches with your parameters to estimate probabilities.

## üìä Example Output

The simulator produces:

- Probability of receiving at least one offer within your timeframe
- Expected number of offers
- Median time to first offer
- Probability timeline showing offer likelihood by day
- Offer count distribution

## üîß Configuration

You can adjust various parameters:

- Time horizon (days to simulate)
- Applications per week
- Resume quality (0-1 scale)
- Interview preparation level (0-1 scale)
- Percentage of applications with referrals
- Industry experience modifier (-0.5 to 0.5)
- Skill match modifier (-0.5 to 0.5)
- Market condition modifier (-0.5 to 0.5)

## üíª Development
